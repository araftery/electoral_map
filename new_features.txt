go back to 2000 with exit poll data (if it exists)
population growth based on census data

ohio turnout hispanic is 95%
try using census survey for turnout

So: get # 2012 voters per group from census (https://www.census.gov/hhes/www/socdemo/voting/publications/p20/2012/tables.html)
get denominator (VEP) from RCP (take their 2016 estimates and subtract the amount they added on)

use census estimates to estimate per-state growth of VEP, not just adding a flat rate for each group (use growth rate of population as VEP growth rate from 2012)

write reasoning (95% in ohio and 0% in wyoming)
